Context Highlight
=================
Context Highlight is a simple tool that allows you to highlight all instances (within a webpage) of a word, several words, or a phrase that you currently have selected. Right click anywhere on the page and choose "Clear Highlighting" to reset the page. Highlighting again will also clear the previous highlight.
